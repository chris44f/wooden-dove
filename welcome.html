      <h2>About Us</h2>
      <img src="" id="welcome_img">
      <p>
        Following a dedicated pastry chef career between London and Lake
        District hotels, modern patisseries and restaurants, Ebony Jemima's
        sheer passion for creating beauty in food took hold. Quickly
        discovering where her heart lay, Ebony moved to permanently specialise
        in wedding cakes, and well, the rest is history!
        <br />
        <br />
        From this life in all things sweet, she and her husband established
        The Wooden Dove Cake Company to provide brides throughout the North
        West with uniquely spectacular cakes. To sum the collections up?
        They're vibrant, visually stunning cakes that taste fantastic and
        give the wow factor as the centrepiece for your wedding.
        <br />
        <br />
        Beginning with your own tailored tasting, we'll discuss exactly what
        you want, matching the colours, themes, and style of your wedding
        with close attention to detail. You decide, we create. It's as simple
        as that.

          "What do we want to offer our clients? I think to us it's about offering
          unique cakes. Instead of traditional iced cakes, these are fresh and
          flavourful creations. From the moment people first walk in to the venue,
          to when they take the final bite, we want to provide a cake that radiates
          the beautiful celebration of your big day. That's our aim."
